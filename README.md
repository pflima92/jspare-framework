The framework was written very carefully, using a few lines of code, but objective, solving simple way their tasks, how to write a Web application StandAlone (You do not need an Application Server) with few lines of code and configuration micromanagement. Still in the framework adopted as a rule, all, or almost all, it must be componentized, highlighting the concept of high cohesion and low coupling, with well-defined interfaces and then to the definition of needs, choose the most appropriate implementation. Simple and intuitive API's that allow scalability of applications, or even the choice of the most appropriate implementations or greater familiarity.
